# simpleForm

A basic script using Tkinter and Openpxyl to create a more convenient way of inputting information into Excel/Spreadsheet. Tkinter is used to design a simple GUI interface and to bind the "Enter" key to the Insert() function. In the script, I chose "Department/School/Number" as the example entry fields. In real-world application, the user could "Tab" to move from entry to entry, and "Enter" to submit that into the row.
